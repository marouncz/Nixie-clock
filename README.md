## Introduction

Hey, this work is still in progress. Stay tuned for new updates!
Hello World, I am currently planning on dedicating some time to describe how I designed the Flyback converter for powering the Nixie Tubes, because as I found out, there really is not much info about designing Flyback converters that go from LV DC to HV DC, but vice versa (household chargers etc.). You can at least look at the schematic in the subfolder in this repo, as I have been busy lately with other projects.
Hope this will help someone in the future while designing custom Flyback converter for Nixie Tubes or other similar applications!
